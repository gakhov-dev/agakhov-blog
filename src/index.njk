      <h3>Game development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Game design - after several years of indie's game dev. I have realized
          that is one I had to start.
          <ul>
            <li>fun, feel, flow</li>
            <li>mechanics</li>
            <li>balance</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Godot - best game engine for indie but you haven't any chance for job
          on it.
          <ul>
            <li>turn base TD, with area control - prototype</li>
            <li>magic maze - prototype</li>
            <li>bots - prototype</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Blender - amazing tool, all in one (3d, animation, texturing). I can
          modeling simple character, texture and rig it. Planning to add here my
          programming skill for procedure generation content and intergation
          with AI.
          <ul>
            <li>low poly modeling</li>
            <li>simple materials, UV</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          UE4 - good engine for 3d, firt, third person. Of cource you can do on
          it anything but be ready to fight. Blueprint is very fun in begin, but
          quickly will became messy. You need to make hard logic in c++ and show
          only hight level custom nodes for gamegesigner.
          <ul>
            <li>blueprint</li>
            <li>async blueprint node on C++</li>
            <li>simple materials</li>
            <li>simple light setting</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Haxe. Interesting technolgy but is not popular.
          <ul>
            <li>children's games for ipad: Multimonster, GreenValley</li>
            <li>tetris like game with numbers - NumTower</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Additional</h3>
      <p>
        I love learning new technologies and implementing them into my work. It
        is possible to change the approach to solving problems and the point of
        view, depending on new opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion is strategy, I like to think broadly and abstractly. Always
        try to go beyond:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>From plan to constant planning.</li>
        <li>From feature to product.</li>
        <li>From product to customer benefit.</li>
      </ul>
